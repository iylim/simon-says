# Simon Says

### MVP Features

In order to make this simple, here is a single user flow you need to implement in order to make this game entertaining and valuable. Please add more to this if your team is comfortable doing so.

Main flow:

1. User requests to start the game.
2. User observes four different sections activating in sequence.
3. The user then has to input the sequence in the correct order.
4. If the user gets it right, they get a point and can go on to longer sequences.
5. If they get it wrong, reset them to the beginning state and ask if they want to try again.

The following technical coding requirements must be satisfied to complete your MVP:

#### JavaScript

- Click event bindings: The user should be able to click each section of the game to activate a section.
- Keyboard event bindings: The user should be able to click on key-bound letters to activate a section.
- Dynamic DOM manipulation: The colors, sounds, **OR** keyboard bindings should randomize each round in some way.
- Sound: The user should be able to hear a musical note when activating a section of the game.

#### HTML

- Semantic markup: Browsers and Users should be able to distinguish correct elements to use in the game.

#### CSS

- Visually engaging: The users should be interested in staying on your application due to engaging designs

#### General

## Planning

1. Scope down your project in terms of skill with your team
2. Different teams may have different scope depending on skill level
   1. You **MUST** negotiate your scope with your project manager (PM): Scott
   2. Each team gets (maximum) 15 minute time chunks with the PM. You are allowed to schedule multiple time chunks, if necessary.
3. Create Issues on GitHub and finish those issues with commits to your code (like a checklist)
